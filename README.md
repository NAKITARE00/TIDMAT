## How It Works

At Tidmat, campaign creators launch data collection campaigns by specifying required data, quality criteria, and reward pools. Contributors securely submit their data via decentralized storage, which is then verified by AI models and on-chain proofs. Tokens are locked in an escrow smart contract and released to contributors once their submissions meet verification standards. A reputations system rewards reliable contributors and campaign creators, ensuring trust and high-quality data exchange.



## For whom ?

Tidmat is a platform for AI researchers, companies, and developers needing verified training data, as well as individuals who want to monetize their data while maintaining privacy. It also benefits verification experts, privacy-conscious users, and crypto investors supporting decentralized data economies.
