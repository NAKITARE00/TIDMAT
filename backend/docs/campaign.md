# Campaign Module Documentation

## Overview
The `campaign.move` module powers the campaign system within the Tidmat ecosystem. It allows creators to initiate data collection campaigns, stake reward pools, manage contributor submissions, and distribute rewards upon successful verification.

## Features
- **Campaign Creation**: Enables creators to launch campaigns and set staking requirements.
- **Contribution Submission**: Allows contributors to submit data for review.
- **Verification & Acceptance**: Creators verify contributions and accept valid submissions.
- **Reward Distribution**: Distributes rewards to successful contributors.
- **Campaign Cancellation**: Allows creators to cancel campaigns under specific conditions.
- **Campaign Inquiry**: Provides views to retrieve campaign details and status.

## Data Structures
### `Campaign`
A struct that represents a campaign:
```move
struct Campaign has key {
    creator: address,
    reward_pool: u64,
    total_contributions: u64,
    verified_contributions: u64,
    active: bool
}
```
- `creator`: The address of the campaign creator.
- `reward_pool`: The total amount staked for rewards.
- `total_contributions`: The number of contributions received.
- `verified_contributions`: The number of accepted contributions.
- `active`: Indicates if the campaign is active.

### `Contribution`

    accepted: bool
}
```
- `contributor`: The address of the contributor.
- `campaign_id`: The ID of the associated campaign.
